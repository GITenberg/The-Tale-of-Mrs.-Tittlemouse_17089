description: "The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse is a children's book written and illustrated\
  \ by Beatrix Potter, and published by Frederick Warne & Co. in 1910. The tale is\
  \ about housekeeping and insect pests in the home, and reflects Potter's own sense\
  \ of tidiness and her abhorrence of insect infestations. The character of Mrs. Tittlemouse\
  \ debuted in 1909 in a small but crucial role in The Tale of The Flopsy Bunnies,\
  \ and Potter decided to give her a tale of her own the following year. Her meticulous\
  \ illustrations of the insects may have been drawn for their own sake, or to provoke\
  \ horror and disgust in her juvenile readers. 25,000 copies of the tale were initially\
  \ released in July 1910 and another 15,000 between November 1910 and November 1911\
  \ in Potter's typical small book format.\nMrs. Tittlemouse is a woodmouse who lives\
  \ in a \"funny house\" of long passages and storerooms beneath a hedge. Her efforts\
  \ to keep her dwelling tidy are thwarted by insect and arachnid intruders who create\
  \ all sorts of messes about the place: a lost beetle leaves dirty footprints in\
  \ a passage and a spider inquiring after Miss Muffet leaves bits of cobweb here\
  \ and there. Her toad neighbour Mr. Jackson lets himself into her parlour, stays\
  \ for dinner, and searches her storerooms for honey but leaves a mess behind. Poor\
  \ Mrs. Tittlemouse wonders if her home will ever be tidy again, but after a good\
  \ night's sleep, she gives her house a fortnight's spring cleaning, polishes her\
  \ little tin spoons, and holds a party for her friends.\nPotter's life had become\
  \ complicated with the demands of ageing parents and the business of operating a\
  \ farm before the composition of Mrs. Tittlemouse, and, as a consequence, her literary\
  \ and artistic productivity began a decline following the tale's publication. She\
  \ continued to publish sporadically but much of her work was drawn from decades-old\
  \ concepts and illustrations. Mrs. Tittlemouse marks the end of her two books a\
  \ year output for Warnes. Scholars find the book's depictions of the insects its\
  \ great attraction. One critic finds a \"nightmarish quality\" in the tale reflected\
  \ in Mrs. Tittlemouse's almost endless war waged against insect pests. Characters\
  \ from the tale have been modelled as porcelain figurines by Beswick Pottery beginning\
  \ in 1948, and the mouse's image appeared on a Huntley & Palmer biscuit tin in 1955.\
  \ Other merchandise has been marketed depicting Mrs. Tittlemouse and her friends.\
  \ Mrs. Tittlemouse was a character in a 1971 ballet film and her tale was adapted\
  \ to an animated television series in 1992.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
